title: Easy-Peasy User Testing
---

[Steam]'s recent Linux celebration sale brought a number of new games into my
life.  They are, on the whole, fun little games, well-deserving of the $2.50 or
so I paid for them.  There are a surprising number, however, that do something
*very* important *very* incorrectly:

Tell me what to do.

It's such a simple thing, but it can ruin my opinion of your game in 30
seconds.  Some games I launch, start the first level, and... well, sit there,
trying to figure out what's supposed to happen.

Honestly, guys, if people [hacking out a game in 48 hours][ggj] can do it, so
can you.  And you really should do so *before* making your game available for
purchase.

The real problem, though, is something deeper.  This issue just makes it
evident the developers did *absolutely no gameplay testing* on people not
already familiar with the game.  This is critical, even if we developers
usually forget it (which is why we've nutured a society full of people
frustrated at technology).  And it's not even [that hard][rocket-surgery].

Ok, I'll help you out.  If you're a mobile developer, just tap the shoulder of
the guy in front of you at the Starbucks line and say something like

> Excuse me.  In exchange for me paying for your coffee, would you play this
> game I'm making while we stand in line?

Not.  Difficult.

While mobile developers may have it slightly easier, it's not terribly hard to
do similar things for traditional applications; there are people everywhere,
many of them already friends with you, and most willing to provide a few
minutes of help in exchange for a beer, a sandwich, or even just karma.

Test your damn product.
