title: The Importance of Usability in Regards to Fire Fighting
---

For Christmas, my parents thoughtfully presented me with a copy of [Web
Operations], a book in which a number of well-known people in, well, the web
operations field write about... web operations.

Anyways, one of the chapters contains an essay by Richard Cook entitled "[How
Complex Systems Fail]", with commentary from [John Allspaw]. The thing that
struck me the most out of those points was the comment that humans under stress
make decicions that are often suboptimal; this struck home for me in relation
to a recent experience.

## An Anecdote

As part of my Christmas vacation, I stayed at my grandparents' house for a few
days.  They've lived there for some time, so the house has a few issues - like
poor plumbing.

Before taking a shower one morning, I used the toilet in, uh, a manner that
would strain their poor pipes.  However, flushing seemed to do the trick at
first glance, so I continued on with my morning regimen.  Some time later, I
noticed that not everything had been successfully evacuated from the toilet
bowl, so I did what any normal person would do - flushed it.

As the tank failed to drain and the water levels rapidly rose, panic rose
within me.

My first thought was to hold down the seat cover.  Thankfully, I realized
rather quickly that this was a silly idea that wouldn't really work. :)

Dismissing that, the only other option I saw was to plunge the toilet.
Unfortunately, by the time I found a plunger, water had spilled onto the
bathroom floor and made a mess of things.

Later, my grandpa asked me why I hadn't just turned off the water.  My answer:

 > It didn't even occur to me.

## And Here Comes Usability

[The Design of Everyday Things] is a wonderful book on general, everyday
usability.  In it, Donald Norman explains his idea of the process a user goes
through to perform an action, termed "[The Seven Stages of Action]".

One of the stages is translating an *intention* into an *action* that can
actually be performed; this becomes difficult if the user is not aware of all
the available actions or is presented with so many that they cannot easily
choose the one that maps correctly to their intention.  The former was my issue
with the overflowing toilet - the "right" action was one that I never even
considered, so how was I to be expected to choose it?

Now, I don't mean to excuse myself by blaming the poor UI design of the
bathroom, but I think it serves as a simple, but useful, example.

Think about your own software - when faced with an emergency, will a user be
able to easily identify the options available to them (and then choose the
correct one)?  Or are they left floundering in a sea of choices, trying every
reasonable option until one works?

Often we neglect polishing our internal tools - if it doesn't affect the
customer, it's not particularly important.  But I say to you that it *does*
affect our customers, for it increases our [mean time to repair] in states of
emergency.

1. Make a list of all the tools you use when firefighting.
2. Improve their usability.
3. ???
4. Profit.
