title: Why Programmers are Egotistical
---

I'm reading through [The Design of Everyday Things] right now.  There's a small
section in the second chapter about [learned helplessness] and taught
helplessness, where the basic idea presented is that when people fail
repeatedly on a seemingly easy task, they come to believe that it's impossible
(for them) and just stop trying.

This violently reminded me of a number of incidents I've seen while a student
in a CS department - students try something, it doesn't do what they expect,
and they give up in frustration ("I can't do this!").  Those students tend to
believe that successful programmers don't encounter these issues, which is
laughable to any professional programmer.  We very rarely do things correctly
the first time, but we *just keep going*.

Now, why do we keep going?  I believe it's because we're all egotistical
bastards.  Well, egotistical somethings, at least.

I've heard a number of non-CS friends describe us as arrogant.  I notice
that my CS courses tend towards a higher ratio of narcissism than GEs.  Hell,
Larry Wall told us that one of the three great virtues of a programmer is
hubris.

I think this is what keeps us going in the face of difficulties - we believe
we're smart enough to do anything, despite any evidence to the contrary.

# So...? #

What implications does this have on CS education?

[My school] has traditionally had a 50% fail rate in our introductory series
(101, 102, 103), with 101 being taught in C.  To address this, they've recently
prepended an additional course that uses ActionScript, Racket or Java to teach
basic CS concepts in various domains (games, music, mobile, etc.).  This isn't
a particularly innovative idea, but it is a good one, and I think it helps with
this problem.

By using an easier introductory course, students will (hopefully!) become
convinced that they can, in fact, program, and this knowledge should help them
persevere when faced with C, a language that is simple but not particularly
intuitive to those new to a low-level of computer abstraction.

Beyond this... I don't know.  The rockstar programmer movement is doing a good
job for intermediate programmers, so I guess we should invite DHH to give a
talk to all our first-year students, or plaster the halls with the awesome
puppy. ;)
