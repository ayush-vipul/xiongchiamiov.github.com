title: If Women
---

One of my housemates was discussing some class material he was assigned to read
that claimed that, among other things, women are better at multitasking. I was
thinking about how men tend to think very procedurally, which is also how we
tend to write programs. So then, if early programmers were mostly women, would
we be having as many issues with concurrency as we are now?

I'd be interested to know if there's any sort of correlation between gender and
ability to easily grok different concurrency models.
