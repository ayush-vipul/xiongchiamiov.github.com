Since the beginnings of programming, so have all projects begun. We wouldn't
want to stray away from tradition now, would we?

As is common in the profession, I have neglected my own website for quite a long
time, favoring instead more interesting projects. Although I finally created a
design and basic skeleton of a site [a few months ago], and even got it running
on one of our virtual machines, I still hadn't created enough of something to
use it quite yet.

I also began to realize that what I was doing was overkill. I started thinking
about some of the pluggable Django blog apps, but even those are far more than I
need.  Enter [Jekyll].

So, my hope is that now I will actually write out things on something a bit more
permanent than my mind.  We shall see...
