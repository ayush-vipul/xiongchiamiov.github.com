title: Taking Another Look at the NSA Surveillance
---

As [others have pointed out][fickle], it seems a bit silly for Americans to be
outraged at [the data the NSA has been collecting on them][PRISM] while we
willingly give every detail of our lives to corporations.  Commentors [have
responded][comment] that the distinction **is** important, because the
government can censor us, while Facebook can merely prevent us from expressing
ourselves on Facebook.  And how important is that, really?

[We already know][edgerank] Facebook's news feed isn't a complete picture -
there's just too much information (and too much of it is particularly
uninteresting) for the news feed to be a simple most-recent-first list of
things your friends post.  We don't know exactly how Facebook decides what to
feature; should we?

A recurring theme in cautionary fiction has always been warnings about
censorship.  In [V for Vendetta], a personal favorite, the fascist government
attempts to use its control over the media to convince its citizens to
discredit and forget about V.  And consider this - if some lone man promised to
expose governmental corruption and bring down the system, with your help, how
hesitant would you be to join him if [you found nothing supporting him on
Facebook][facebook search], the Twitterverse was silent on the matter, and
[your Google searches found nothing positive][bubbling]?

A democracy will fail without informed voters.  Voters can only be fully
informed if others have the freedom to report their circumstances and opinions.
And [we cannot have freedom of speech without anonymity][psuedonyms], which is
exactly what pervasive recording like that done by [Facebook][beacon],
[Google][signed-out], and, yes, the NSA, strives against.

It's true that we unwittingly give over hordes of information to corporations
every day.  But the similarities between this data collection and what the NSA
does should not be used to excuse the NSA - they should be a sign that our
outrage should be extended to privacy-lax corporations and, most importantly,
ourselves.
