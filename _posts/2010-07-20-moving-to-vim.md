title: Moving to vim
---

I really want to move from Komodo to vim. Sure, [I love Komodo], but sometimes
it can just be freakin' annoying.

So, here's a list of things I want vim to be able to do for me to switch:

* Display line numbers
* Split screen horizontally or vertically, and move files between the two
* Show a tree-based overview of a directory (preferably with the ability to open files from there).  Showing and hiding this quickly is important.
* Use the indentation already present in a file
* Use the line-endings already present in a file
* Show me when indentation is mismatched, or allow me to turn on whitespace characters easily.
* Code folds are created automatically based on syntax/indentation/braces/whatever.
* I can complete words that I've typed previously.
* Tab completion.
* Tooltips or similar remind me of function parameters.
* I'm presented with valid choices for css rules.
* Autocompletion of braces, parens, end blocks, etc.

Updates will be made to this page as I find answers.
