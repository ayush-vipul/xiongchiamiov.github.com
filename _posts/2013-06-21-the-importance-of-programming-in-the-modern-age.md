title: The Importance of Programming in the Modern Age
---

I found myself musing [once again] over my motivation for programming - I'll
save you the reading and tell you that it's not the problem solving, but the
potential for *creative expression* that gets me.  Programmers are the wizards
of the modern age, creating anything they can imagine out of absolutely
nothing.  And this lead me to a realization:

**The ability to program is the great democratization.**

It used to be that land-owners had control over society.  Then, as our world
shifted away from an agricultural focus, the very rich joined the power club.
But now, with a little bit of learning, anyone can have the control over their
own life they've always wanted.

When most people use a computer, they have to put up with the poor software
they encounter.  They may think to themselves, "Gee, it'd be great if I could
do X", but then they sigh and continue on with their lives.

As a programmer, I am exempt from this.  When I get frustrated at a piece of
software, or see a need not being filled, I am no longer powerless - *I* can
change it, with the power of programming.

And it's not just your personal life.  [Hacktivism] is a growing trend.  And if
the lawyers for Anonymous protestors [get their way][DOS is free speech], the
power to influence politics will shift - from the owners of the media to the
programmers who can replicate themselves a thousand times over.

It's true that some have forseen this and amassed large groups of programmers
under their command.  But even here we are not without hope.  As video games
have [become a larger industry than movies][vg>m], an opposing force of [small,
independent game developers][indie games] has risen up to meet it.  These are
studios of only a few people - often, two - creating the type of games they've
been frustrated to see the hundred-person studios avoid.  And many times, these
have proven [wildly successful][Minecraft], proving the individual can still
take the path to control.

If you find this subject interesting, read up on [Distributism], a social,
political, and economic theory that advocates giving individuals control over
their own lives, something [very much in line][Telepath Tactics] with the indie
game movement.
