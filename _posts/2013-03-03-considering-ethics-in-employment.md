title: Considering Ethics in Employment
---

I've been reading some [Peter Singer] recently, particularly [his writings] on
poverty.  The very-short conclusion to his argument is that those of us living
in developed nations are *morally obligated* to give to charities to supported
those who need help most, in as high a quantity as we can give without being
hurting our lifestyle (or our dependents') in any significant way.

As an example, you could use your salary to purchase a nice Mercedes-Benz, or
instead drive a similarly-sized Toyota and give the extra money you would have
spent to [Doctors Without Borders].  Since this doesn't have a drastic effect
on your life (your car still transports you reliably from one place to another,
is reasonably safe, etc.) and the benefit you can provide is so great ([World
Vision claims] they can provide enough food and medicine to a child to help
them survive for their first five years for only 19 USD), you are doing wrong
if you do not follow this path.  There are additional complexities to Singer's
argument, but I'll let you [read them yourself].

Through [Code.org], I recently found [SocialCoding4Good], a site that helps
developers and sysadmins connect to projects that need their help.  This is
great, and I encourage you to sign up, or use some of [Code.org's other
resources][help] to find a place to help out.

However, I'd like to present a challenge: is this enough?

Computers are now used in every area of life, and correspondingly programmers
work in [a wide variety of industries][bls].  We need people working on
airplanes and traffic lights and shipping logistics.  There is a definite focus
in Silicon Valley, however, on companies producing things that, well, aren't
really that *important* on a global scale.  The question, then, is this: is it
ok to donate a few hours of your time while working for yet another social
media company when you could instead be saving lives 8 hours a day?
