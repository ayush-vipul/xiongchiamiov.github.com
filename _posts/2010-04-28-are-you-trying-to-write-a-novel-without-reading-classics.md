title: Are You Trying to Write a Novel Without Reading Classics?
---

While writing some thoughts of mine about open-source software (for which I
broke my 10-minute rule and haven't finished for a few days >_>) I realized that
there are two primary reasons I think open-source programmers tend to be better
than the average coder:

 * They write more code.
 * They read more code.

While I've heard lots of contention over the first point, I don't recall reading
much of anything about the second. The topic just came up in my LUG's irc
channel, though, and I got two people to agree with me (and none dissenting, so
I must assume I'm correct!).

I often think that I've come up with a pretty cool solution, until I see what
other people have done. I saw this with my "discovery" of the model-view
paradigm, with [my second irc bot], and repeatedly in my Programming Languages
course (damn you Austin!).

Oh, but yes, back to what I mentioned in the title - programmers who don't make
a habit of reading other people's code are like authors who don't read others'
books.

So, whether it be [a short story] or [an epic novel], find yourself some
printouts and get reading.
