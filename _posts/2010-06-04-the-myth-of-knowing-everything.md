title: The Myth of Knowing Everything
---

I occasionally hear people say, essentially, that all programming languages are
the same. For instance, I'm taking a course from a difficult (but good)
professor this next fall quarter. I'm a little worried, as the class is
traditionally taught in C++, and I'm a scripting language guy. I'll express this
to someone and hear

**No, they aren't.**

Now, sure, if you take a C hacker and make him write Lisp, he'll probably get
the job done. But it'll look like C, not Lisp, and that is a Bad Thing.

More importantly, take the Lisper and force him to use C, and he'll be lost
without all of the powerful features that he's used to using all of the time
(well, I suppose the C hacker would find the lack of pointers annoying, too).

You see the same thing with any change in paradigm: object-oriented vs.
procedural, functional vs. imperative, dynamically-typed vs. statically-typed.
If you've ever been on a project where someone is learning the implementation
language, it's painfully obvious which code is theirs, because they just
approach problems *differently*.

Good programmers [often][0] [recommend][1] learning different programming
languages, not merely for the practicality, but for the different mindsets
gained from each. Trust them, and stop dismissing my fears. Fear can be a good
thing.
