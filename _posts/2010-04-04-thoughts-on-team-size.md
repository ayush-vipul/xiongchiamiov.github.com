title: Thoughts on Team Size
---

Working on a team is a fact of reality for most people, programmers not
excluded. Now, there is a lot to say about teams, but I'm really just interested
in spouting off a few thoughts about the team's size, at the moment.

Teams of five to eight seem to work well, in my (rather limited) experience.
Someone will emerge as the leader, someone will keep them on track, and the rest
of us end up fitting together with our own specialities and peculiarities. There
may be some troubles between some of the more conflicting personalities, but
you're likely to have a mediator to help resolve the situation peacefully.

Pairs, however, suck, or rather, have high potential to suck. If you don't
choose your partner carefully, then you may be missing a personality trait that
is essential for your success.

Even more importantly, everything becomes personal. With a larger team, having
the team leader tell you to get something done isn't so bad, because it's "the
team" telling you. With just one other person, though, it comes out as "you
aren't pulling your fair share of the load", even if that's not what was
intended.

Working by yourself, of course, avoids this issue, because it **is** personal.

Also, as I like to tell people, it's hard to miscommunicate with yourself.
