title: Open-Source as an Integral Part of Development
---

Every time I start working on a new piece of code, my workflow is something
like this:

1. Come up with a name.  If none within 30 seconds, choose an unused one from
the Wikipedia list of Cats characters.
2. Create directory in `~/Documents` and `cd` into it.
3. `tmux new -s project-name`
4. `git init`
5. Create a new tmux window.
6. `vim`

I create a git repository before I even open my text editor or a REPL.  As soon
as I write down what I want to do in a README or hack out a script that spits
*something* onto the screen without (too many) errors, I make my first commit.
The first break, it goes up on Github.  I am a programmer, and this is how I
program.

*I'll upload it to Github after I clean it up a bit.*  One of my personal goals
is to find every person who says this and badger them until they release their
code.

Your code is ugly?  I don't care - mine's uglier.  I know the dirty secret all
programmers share - code never emerges fully-formed, glistening in the sunlight
as a shining example of the modern mind.  No, the very first thing you write
probably doesn't even work.  Oops, forgot  semi-colon.  Neither does the second
- you forgot to define that variable.  But gradually a form begins to take
shape, crafted by your relentless fingers.  **This** is where your brilliant
ideas begin to appear - a chin here, an arm there.  **This** is what I want to
see - this fascinating growth, this inspiring genesis.

*Stay away!* you shout.  *It's not finished!* you protest.

But I am no mere outsider, no window-shopper casually glancing in.  I am a
craftsman, a brother - I recognize the unrefined beauty within and celebrate
what is to come.

And if the inspiration leaves as quickly as it came, I may pull off the dusty
sheet and continue your work someday.  Perhaps I never even met you - this shop
is long-abandoned, with only the works left to tell of its owner.  But as I
work, crafting upon your base, there is a connection - I may not have met you,
but I know you.
