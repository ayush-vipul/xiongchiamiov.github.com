title: Don't Ask Me Commands
---

I've noticed that some team leads (who are often placed in such a position due
to their technical prowess, rather than any leadership ability) have a tendency
to ask questions when they really want to tell me to do something. For instance:

> So, are we going to have the FooBar done by Monday?

My response to that question will be based upon my current set of priorities,
and very well may be "No.".  Now, if you said

> Make sure FooBar is done by Monday.

then I will adjust my schedule accordingly.

From a programming perspective, questions are effect-free. If you call, say,
`piano.tuned?` (or `piano.getTuned()`), no instance variables in `piano` should
be modified!

So, if/when you lead a team, no matter how small, *please* grow enough balls to
tell someone when you want something.
