title: The Programmer's UI
---

I keep finding [The Design of Everyday Things] more and more useful, both in
understanding why things are the way they are and in helping me improve my own
designs.  If you don't have a copy of it, go get one.  I'll wait.

Ok, now that you're back, I'd like to share how it helped me process the
reasons for the existence of one of our users' most dreaded enemies:

## The Programmer's UI

You've seen it.  The interface only its designer could love.

Programmers are notorious for creating UIs like this - busy with buttons,
lavished with links, filled with forms.  But why is this?  *Why* do we create
such god-awful things that make our users curse us (and computers in general)
to the deepest level of hell?

I think that it, very simply, has to do with one of the steps we take while
using a system - determining which actions are available to us.

There are over 30 choices for a user in that screen above - *thirty*.  Say
it takes half a second to determine if an option matches the action you wish to
take - you could easily spend 15 seconds just figuring out which button to
press.  The programmer who designed those buttons, however, already knows all
about them, so it only takes him half a second - and then he wonders why anyone
has difficulty!  After all, every option is *right there*, at your fingertips!

As the arrogant souls that we are, programmers have a tendency to look down on
their users.  Why can't they just do the right thing?  Why are they doing
that!?  Why can't I only have *smart* people use my software?

To help combat this, I find it useful to ask a fellow programmer for feedback -
someone I trust and respect, but who isn't familiar with whatever I'm working
on.  Then, if they tell me the UI sucks, I'm forced to admit it and make it
better.

Of course, if you want to continue creating horrific UIs, I won't stop you.
It's job security for me...
