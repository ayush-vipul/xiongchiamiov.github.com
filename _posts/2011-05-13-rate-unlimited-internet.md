In recent months, our house has had blessedly little contact with Charter, our
ISP. We did get contacted in February, however, because I was attempting to
regain data that I had lost in a tragic sysadminning accident - and apparently
they aren't happy about us downloading a terabyte and a half in a month.

You see, Charter (like most other American ISPs) has traffic caps. Now, I have
no problem with monthly caps; it just seems to me that they should come without
artificial rate limitations. I mean, whether I download 250 GB in 2 days or 30,
what does it matter to them?

Oh, that's right.  Because they want me to pay more money.
