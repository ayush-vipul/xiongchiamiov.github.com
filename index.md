This is the current homepage of James Pearson, known as [Xiong Chiamiov] across
the internets. After several years of procrastination, I'm finally getting
something up on here, thanks in large part to the ability to write posts in
[Markdown], the best \*-to-html syntax out there.

Anyways, you can find a few things around here, mostly about programming - if
that doesn't interest you, your time might best be spent elsewhere ;). Just
start clicking around in that menu up top.

If you got here looking for my slides from my talk at the 2010 Central Coast Code Camp, head over [to my Github][talk] for the [showoff] presentation files, or just grab [the pdf] (unfortunately without images :/ ).
