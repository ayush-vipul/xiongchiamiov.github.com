title: Introduction - An Introduction to Redmine

Issue trackers are at the heart of any significant software project.
Particularly for someone with as bad a memory as me, the tracker is invaluable
for reminding developers what needs to be done, and in what order.

For a user, knowing the standard workflows in trackers allows them to navigate a
project's tracker and poke and prod in the right places to get their issue
resolved.

Here, I'll be talking specifically about Redmine, although the same principles
apply to other popular issue trackers, including Trac (upon which Redmine is
modelled) and Bugzilla. The intent is to provide an overview of how to actually
*use* an issue tracker, rather than the setup guides than are much more
prominent on the internet.
