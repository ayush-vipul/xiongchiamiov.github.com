You'll see a list of public projects and any projects (private or public) that

BakaBT is a subproject of Pearson's Life, and Text Star Sim is a subproject of
Star Sim. This means that any issues in BakaBT appear also in Pearson's Life,
and any members added to Pearson's Life also have access to BakaBT.
