Within the last 15 years, use of the World Wide Web has exploded. From finding
out what other movies that actor was in with the touch of a few buttons to
finding old highschool classmates, the web has changed our lives. And here's
some good news: it is extraordinarily easy to make your own web presence!

However, that low barrier of entry has also bred a mess of poorly-designed
websites. With very few formal education opportunities in the area, aspiring
individuals are forced to turn to books and online tutorials, many of which are
less than satisfactory.

It is my goal, then, to teach you, my dear reader, how to do things The Right
Way, saving you from learning it through experience, as I have. While there may
be a higher initial cost, it is my hope that you will find the end result to be
well worth the time spent, and enjoy your new-found respect among your friends
and family as le designer extraordinaire.
