<p>As a result of both being an introvert and having professors who seem to
enjoy requiring me to sit in classes, then neglecting to provide me with any new
information, I think a lot. Specifically, I talk to myself, and write
poorly-edited essays in my head. Since I also happen to be an archivist, I have
created this space to allow me to forever preserve my ramblings.</p>

<p>I make a point of avoiding anything more than minimal editing in my writing,
so that it sounds similar to how I speak.</p>

<p>I avoid calling this a blog, as that would lead people to believe:</p>

<ul>
<li> this will be updated frequently</li>
<li> events of my life will appear here</li>
<li> I have something to say that you will find interesting</li>
</ul>

<p>I guarantee none of these (and am inclined to say that the 2nd item will
never happen).</p>

<p>For the same reason, I don't anticipate ever creating an RSS feed. If I do,
then I'd start to only publish things that I think people will want to read, and
I wish to avoid that.</p>

{% for page in site.posts %}
	<div class="date">
		{{ page.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}
	</div>
	<a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a><br />
{% endfor %}
