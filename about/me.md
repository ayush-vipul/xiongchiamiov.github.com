During the day, I work as a Senior [Site Reliability Engineer] at [WePay].
I've previously worked at a robotics startup, [reddit], [iFixit], and a few
small local gigs.  If you're interested in that, you can find more information
in [my resume].

I'm a big proponent of open-source, with over 150 GitHub repositories and
patches accepted into over 40 projects.  I'm also the author and maintainer of
9 git/GitHub tools, [11 RubyGems], and 9 Python packages.  You'll also find me
active on [the Stack Exchange network][Stack Exchange], as a top 0.5% user on
[Stack Overflow] and [Server Fault], and one of the top 100 users by reputation
on [the Information Security site][sec.SE].

[PHP] was my first true programming language that I spent any time with, and it
was my primary until the summer after my freshman year of [university][Cal
Poly], when I started working for the [College of Engineering] on
[Django]-powered websites.  I fell in love with [Python] and [its
philosophy][pep-20], and it's been my primary language since then.  I'm also
pretty comfortable with Bash and Ruby.

On the [DISC] view of the universe, I have a natural ranking of 100 S and C, 23
D and 7 I, which puts me as a pure Coordinator. While not a natural leader in
any way, I'm rebellious enough to tell the project lead (plainly) when I think
they've made a poor choice, but passive enough to follow their final decisions.

I'm very slowly working on [an introductory book on web operations][Growing
Up].
