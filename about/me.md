## Programming

I'm currently finishing up my 4th year as a Software Engineering student at [Cal
Poly], the best university around. ;) I'm employed part-time as a "code frog"
(yes, that is my title) at [iFixit].

[PHP] was my first true programming language that I spent any time with, and it
was my primary until the summer after my freshman year of university, when I
started working for the [College of Engineering] on [Django]-powered websites.
[Python] has been my primary language since then, although I'm finding myself
writing more and more in [Ruby], because it's so damn fun!

I am also acquainted in various degrees with HTML, CSS, Javascript (mostly with
[jQuery]), Java, C, [Lua] and Scheme. I am learning [Scala] next, and possibly
[Haskell], [D] or [Factor] after that, but plans tend to get altered as time passes.

Other than the work that I did for Cal Poly, and most class assignments, all of
my code is available on [my GitHub account].

## Personality

On the [DISC] view of the universe, I have a natural ranking of 100 S and C, 23
D and 7 I, which puts me as a pure Coordinator. While not a natural leader in
any way, I'm rebellious enough to tell the project lead (plainly) when I think
they've made a poor choice, but passive enough to follow their final decisions.

While many people may find me a bit odd (I have a tendency to keep to myself,
and have been known to go through a course without ever speaking a word), it is
rare to find someone who dislikes me.

I maintain [a list][reading-list] of books I've recently read.
