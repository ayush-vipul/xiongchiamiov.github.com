## Programming

I'm currently a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at [Cal Poly], the best
university around. ;) I'm employeed part-time as a programmer/sys-admin at
[MathTV.com], a local math textbook company. While it may not have the glamour
of some other jobs, I have very flexible hours, work with nice people, and get
paid to work on open-source projects.  Win!

[PHP] was my first true programming language that I spent any time with, and it
was my primary until the summer after my freshman year of university, when I
started working for the [College of Engineering] on [Django]-powered websites.
[Python] has been my primary language since then, although I'm finding myself
writing more and more in [Ruby], because it's so damn fun!

I am also acquainted in various degrees with HTML, CSS, Javascript (mostly with
[jQuery]), Java, C, [Lua] and Scheme. I hope to be learning [Scala] next, and
possibly Haskell after that, but plans tend to get altered as time passes.

Other than the work that I did for Cal Poly, and most class assignments, all of
my code is available on [my GitHub account].

## Personality

On the [DISC] view of the universe, I have a natural ranking of 100 S and C, 23
D and 7 I, which puts me as a pure Coordinator. While not a natural leader in
any way, I'm rebellious enough to tell the project lead (plainly) when I think
they've made a poor choice, but passive enough to follow their final decisions.

While many people may find me a bit odd (I have a tendency to keep to myself,
and have been known to go through a course without ever speaking a word), it is
rare to find someone who dislikes me.
