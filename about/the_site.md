title: The Site - About
---

This is a [Jekyll]-powered site, hosted on [GitHub]. It came from
[rumpleteazer], which was a half-finished Django site that never really needed
to be coded in the first place.

Most things around here are hand-coded. The posts are written in [Markdown] and
auto-converted to html by Jekyll, and I use [jQuery] as a Javascript library. I
created the graphics using [the GIMP]; some of them originally came from some
free-use place on the 'net, but I'm ashamed to say I didn't keep track of where.
For the curious, 'twas all done in [Komodo Edit].
